## Introducing the Alzheimer's Disease Info Assistant

We are excited to announce the release of a new pilot tool, the "Alzheimer's Disease Info Assistant", powered by the latest GPT4 model. This tool is available at [Alzheimer's Disease Info Assistant](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-7kFSx5kWc-alzheimer-s-disease-info-assistant).

### Tool Features

The Alzheimer's Info Assistant prioritizes clear, concise, and accurate information delivery. The assistant uses technical terms appropriately and explains complex data concepts in an academic style. The assistant is designed to ask for clarification on vague queries to provide the most relevant and accurate information. It focuses on data availability, types, and access methods, and always cites sources for the information, especially when providing URLs for further reference.

### Information Sources

The Alzheimer's Info Assistant utilizes information from public and reputable sources such as the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC), the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC), the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA), and the Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Portal.

### Application of the Tool

We have used this new tool to generate the information displayed on our [Multimodality Data](/AIM-AI/Multimodal-data/) page. We believe this tool will be a valuable resource for anyone seeking in-depth knowledge about Alzheimer's disease data.

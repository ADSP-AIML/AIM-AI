### AIM-AI: An Actionable, Integrated and Multiscale genetic map of Alzheimer’s disease via deep learning
<div class="jumbotron">
  <!-- <h1 class="display-4">AIM-AI: An Actionable, Integrated and Multiscale genetic map of Alzheimer’s disease via deep learning</h1> -->
  <p class="lead">Our mission is to transform the genetic catalog of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) into an actionable, integrated, and multiscale resource. We aim to make genetic factors useful for further studies and to better understand AD and its cognitive decline.</p>
  <hr class="my-4">
  <p>We will explore multiple-omics systems, develop integrated systems, and use a multiscale systems biology approach. Our proposal has three specific aims:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Aim 1:</strong> Develop a deep learning framework, "DeepBrain-AD", to characterize the genetic risk of AD using both bulk brain tissue and single-cell regulatory genomics.</li>
    <li><strong>Aim 2:</strong> Identify variants that account for cognitive decline due to AD progression by developing deep learning models that connect multiple modalities (imaging, clinical, genomics) in a joint analysis framework.</li>
    <li><strong>Aim 3:</strong> Assess and validate the genetic variants from Aims 1 and 2 using multiple omics data to illustrate molecular systems which mediate their effects.</li>
  </ul>

### An Actionable, Integrated and Multiscale genetic map of Alzheimer’s disease via deep learning

Our aim is to create a robust AI framework, AIM-AI (an Actionable, Integrated and Multiscale genetic map of Alzheimer’s disease via deep learning), to transform the genetic catalog of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) into an actionable, integrated, and multiscale resource. This will allow genetic factors to be useful for further studies. We will explore multiple-omics systems to understand the effects of genetic factors at a cellular level. We will develop integrated systems that include genetic, phenotypic, multi-omics, cell context, neuroimaging, and knowledgebase information. We will use a multiscale systems biology approach to identify changes in genetics, neuroimaging, and phenotypes to better understand AD and its cognitive decline. We will examine AD characteristics at various levels, allowing for a more thorough assessment and validation of the role genetics play in cognitive decline and AD phenotypes. Our proposal has three specific aims:

**Aim 1:** Develop a deep learning framework, "DeepBrain-AD", to characterize the genetic risk of AD using both bulk brain tissue and single-cell regulatory genomics.

**Aim 2:** Identify variants that account for cognitive decline due to AD progression by developing deep learning models that connect multiple modalities (imaging, clinical, genomics) in a joint analysis framework.

**Aim 3:** Assess and validate the genetic variants from Aims 1 and 2 using multiple omics data to illustrate molecular systems which mediate their effects.

In summary, we will uniquely investigate and validate genetic variants and other markers in AD at multi-omics level, at the cell-type context and single-cell resolution; and link the genetic association signals with functional regulation, protein expression, and neuroimaging context; and finally explain their roles in cognitive decline due to AD progression. The successful completion of this project will generate a robust AIM-Al framework, including machine learning methods/tools, resources, and scientific discoveries through integrative omics, deep learning, and other systems-based approaches, which will be immediately shared with AD and other disease research communities.

# AIM-AI Project

Massive amounts of genetic, genomic, neuroimaging, endophenotypic and clinical data have been generated for Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) and shared with the research communities; however, it is still largely unknown about its molecular mechanisms, biomarkers for diagnosis or prevention, or therapeutic targets for the AD treatment. To effectively address the current challenges in high complexity data in AD, in this proposal we assemble an interdisciplinary team to develop and implement a robust artificial intelligence (AI) framework, namely AIM-AI, for transforming the genetic catalog of AD in a way that is Actionable, Integrated and Multiscale, so that genetic factors have clear utility for subsequent etiological studies focusing on cognitive systems. The successful completion of this project will generate a robust AIM-AI framework, including machine learning methods/tools, resources, and scientific discoveries, which will be immediately shared with AD and other complex disease research communities.

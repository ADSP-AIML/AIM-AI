Our overall goal is to develop and implement a robust Al framework, namely AIM-Al, for transforming the genetic catalog of AD in a way that is Actionable, !ntegrated and Multiscale, so that genetic factors have clear utility for subsequent etiological studies. To make our findings Actionable, we explore multiple-omics systems that functionally intercept the effects of genetic factors at the cell-type-specific and single-cell resolution. We will develop !ntegrated and brain-data-driven collective systems, covering genetic, phenotypic, multi-omics, cell context, neuroimaging and knowledgebase information. Finally, a Multiscale systems biology approach will be implemented to identify genetic, neuroimaging, and phenotypic changes, which in combination can better explain the genetic architecture of AD and its cognitive decline. We will mine the AD characteristics at functional, cellular, tissue- and cell type-specific, and neuroimaging levels, enabling more rigorous assessment and validation that genetics effects indeed play out in cognitive decline and AD phenotypes.
